            <p>
                I mostly play video games in my spare time, both single-player and competitive multiplayer. 
                At the moment, I am playing Persona 5 Royal which is a Japanese Role-Playing Game (**RPG**) which combines a traditional dungeon crawler with a social life simulator.
                Even though I have still not finished the game as of Feb 2022, it is one of my all-time favourites as you can probably tell from my 'Top 3 Video Games' list.
                In terms of multiplayer games, I only play Overwatch, which is hero First-Person Shooter (FPS).
                This means each character will have unique weapons and abilities specific to that character, which lends itself to certain playstyles for each character.
                You therefore have to think more about strategy such as if a certain character fits your team composition or if you should swap to a character with enhanced mobility if you need to survive getting jumped.
                Combine this with the relatively fast-paced nature of the game, it means that you do need quick thinking and mechanics as well as adapting on the fly if something goes wrong or if the team adapts to you and so you have to counter-adapt.
                In my opinion, there isn't a game that does this well or at least scratch that itch for me
                It however can be a frustrating game due to people's poor behaviour which is arises from the high-level dependency between teammates. 
                For example, a Tank player may not be getting enough healing do their job and may starting having a go at healers but they may not realize what the healers are getting targetted and need protection and the healers may feel that they are not the sole issue to why the team is losing.

                As I mainly play on PC, I typically build my PCs.

                I learnt to program initially in MatLab for my uni course. 
                However since MatLab is proprietary ie you have to pay for it (it was free on the university computers) and online resources may be scarce as it is a niche language that you do have to pay, I moved onto Python.
                With Python I have made a number of programs such as: 
                <br>
                
                    <ol>
                    <li class="pyproj">web scraping scripts</li>
                    <dd><ul><li>to get real estate agent's information for a friend, who is a web designer to specialized in creating websites for real estates agents.</li></ul></dd>
                    
                    <li class="pyproj">Discord bot</li>

                    <dd>
                        <ul>
                            <li>to scrape and post in Discord the latest sale posts on r/NintendoSwitchDeals and r/buildapcsalesuk</li> 
                            <li>to stream audio from Youtube or download and play it locally</li> 
                            <li>to scrape data such as ideal weapon perks on light.gg for the game Destiny 2</li> 
                            <li>to compare people's weapons inventory to the aforementioned ideal weapons data</li> 
                        </ul>
                        
                    </dd>

                    <li class="pyproj">Shiny Hunting program</li>
                    <dd> <ul> <li>this alerted me to the appearance of a rare, shiny (alternate coloured) Pokemon by streaming the video from the Switch to the PC and calculating the time between the black screen and the battle options screen as a shiny pokemon has an added animation to indicate its shininess</li> </ul> </dd>

                    <li class="pyproj">Pokemon Damage Calculator</li>
                    <dd>
                        <ul>
                        <li>this calculator uses relative terms to calculate damage rather than using exact values.
                        This is much easier as most damage calculators would require exact numbers and stats for Pokemon which can be hard to find.
                        The program uses GUI and updates the calculations as you type the inputs, so you don't have to click 'Enter' each time</li>
                        </ul>
                    </dd>
                    </ol>

                I have a rare, long-term condition called pulmonary hypertension. 
                <a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/our-research/research-successes/treating-pulmonary-hypertension">Only 8,000 people in the UK have it.</a> 
                The main symptoms are breathlessness and tiredness as the heart has to work a lot harder to pump blood through restrictive blood vessels in the lungs, which leads to high blood pressure in the lungs, hence the name pulmonary hypertension.
